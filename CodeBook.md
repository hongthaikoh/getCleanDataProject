## Background Info

### Data Set Description
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.txt'
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
- The units used for the accelerations (total and body) are 'g's (gravity of earth -> 9.80665 m/seg2).
- The gyroscope units are rad/seg.
- A video of the experiment including an example of the 6 recorded activities with one of the participants can be seen in the following link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOEN9W05_4A

Description of abbreviations of measurements

leading t or f is based on time or frequency measurements.
Body = related to body movement.
Gravity = acceleration of gravity
Acc = accelerometer measurement
Gyro = gyroscopic measurements
Jerk = sudden movement acceleration
Mag = magnitude of movement
mean and SD are calculated for each subject for each activity for each mean and SD measurements.
The units given are g’s for the accelerometer and rad/sec for the gyro and g/sec and rad/sec/sec for the corresponding jerks.

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
‘-XYZ’ is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. They total 33 measurements including the 3 dimensions - the X,Y, and Z axes.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag
The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

### Steps taken to prepare tidy data

Download Data from link provided in Course Project

```
filesPath <- "D:/DataScience/Coursera/UCI HAR Dataset"
setwd(filesPath)
if(!file.exists("./data")){dir.create("./data")}
fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
download.file(fileUrl,destfile="./data/Dataset.zip",method="curl")
```

Unzip Data to ./data directory

```
unzip(zipfile="./data/Dataset.zip",exdir="./data")
```

Load dplyr, data.table, tidyr packages

```
library(dplyr)
library(data.table)
library(tidyr)
```

```
filesPath <- "D:/DataScience/Coursera/UCI HAR Dataset/data"
```

Read subject files

```
dataSubjectTrain <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(filesPath, "train", "subject_train.txt")))
dataSubjectTest  <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(filesPath, "test" , "subject_test.txt" )))
```

Read activity files

```
dataActivityTrain <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(filesPath, "train", "y_train.txt")))
dataActivityTest  <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(filesPath, "test" , "y_test.txt" )))
```

Read data files

```
dataTrain <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(filesPath, "train", "X_train.txt" )))
dataTest  <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(filesPath, "test" , "X_test.txt" )))
```

####1. Merges the training and the test data to become one dataset.

Rename variables "subject" and "activityNum"

```
alldataSubject <- rbind(dataSubjectTrain, dataSubjectTest)
setnames(alldataSubject, "V1", "subject")
alldataActivity<- rbind(dataActivityTrain, dataActivityTest)
setnames(alldataActivity, "V1", "activityNum")
```

Join 2 sets of training and test dataset

```
dataTable <- rbind(dataTrain, dataTest)
```

Match variables to feature e.g.(V1 = "tBodyAcc-mean()-X")

```
dataFeatures <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(filesPath, "features.txt")))
setnames(dataFeatures, names(dataFeatures), c("featureNum", "featureName"))
colnames(dataTable) <- dataFeatures$featureName
```

Match column names for activity labels

```
activityLabels<- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(filesPath, "activity_labels.txt")))
setnames(activityLabels, names(activityLabels), c("activityNum","activityName"))
```

Merge columns

```
alldataSubjAct <- cbind(alldataSubject, alldataActivity)
dataTable <- cbind(alldataSubjAct, dataTable)
```

####2. Extracts measurements with mean value and standard deviation value for each measurement.

Reading "features.txt" and extracting only the mean and standard deviation

```
dataFeaturesMeanStd <- grep("mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)",dataFeatures$featureName,value=TRUE)
```

Extracts only measurements with mean value and standard deviation value and add 2 columns "subject","activityNum"

```
dataFeaturesMeanStd <- union(c("subject","activityNum"), dataFeaturesMeanStd)
dataTable<- subset(dataTable,select=dataFeaturesMeanStd) 
```

####3. Rename activities with user descriptive activity names in the dataset

Merges name of activity into dataTable

```
dataTable <- merge(activityLabels, dataTable , by="activityNum", all.x=TRUE)
dataTable$activityName <- as.character(dataTable$activityName)
```

Creates dataTable with variable means, order by Subject and Activity by using arrange

```
dataTable$activityName <- as.character(dataTable$activityName)
dataAggr<- aggregate(. ~ subject - activityName, data = dataTable, mean) 
dataTable<- tbl_df(arrange(dataAggr,subject,activityName))
```

####4. Rename the labels of dataset with user descriptive variable names.

Leading t or f is based on time or frequency measurements.

1. Body = related to body movement.
2. Gravity = acceleration of gravity
3. Acc = accelerometer measurement
4. Gyro = gyroscopic measurements
5. Jerk = sudden movement acceleration
6. Mag = magnitude of movement
7. mean and SD are calculated for each subject for each activity for each mean and SD measurements. 
8. The units given are g's for the accelerometer and rad/sec for the gyro and g/sec and rad/sec/sec for the corresponding jerks.

```
names(dataTable)<-gsub("std()", "SD", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("mean()", "MEAN", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("^t", "time", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("^f", "frequency", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("Acc", "Accelerometer", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("Gyro", "Gyroscope", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("Mag", "Magnitude", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("BodyBody", "Body", names(dataTable))
```


####5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

write to text file on disk

```
write.table(dataTable, "new_tidy_table.txt", row.name=FALSE)
```
